    "\n",
    "An **image kernel** (also called a filter or convolution matrix) is a small matrix used to apply effects such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more to images. The kernel is moved across the image, and at each position, a mathematical operation (usually convolution) is performed between the kernel and the underlying image pixels.\n",

    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
